🎵 Music Store Database Analysis with PostgreSQL
📖 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Music Store Database using PostgreSQL to extract meaningful business insights. The dataset contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, genres, and more. By writing efficient SQL queries, I answered key questions related to sales, customer behavior, and music preferences.

🚀 Why PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL was the ideal choice for this project due to its powerful features:

Advanced SQL Capabilities: PostgreSQL supports complex queries using window functions, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
Reliability: It efficiently handles large datasets with high performance.
Open Source: Free and community-driven, making it accessible to all.
Rich Analytical Functions: Simplifies aggregation, ranking, filtering, and data manipulation tasks.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Suitable for various domains and applications.
